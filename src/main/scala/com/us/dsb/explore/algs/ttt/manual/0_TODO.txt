Selected to-do items:
- add representative mocking-base _non_--end-to-end testing of GameUI (probably
  first adjust to inject GameState, then inject test double for GameState)
- maybe split getAndDoUiCommands's looping from command evaluation (re easier
  testing)
- research and try FP-style restructuring of GameUI, especially re reducing
  mocking
